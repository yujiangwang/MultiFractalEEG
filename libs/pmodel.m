function varargout = pmodel(noValues, p, slope)
% This function generates a multifractal time series using the p-model.
% Optionally you can also filter the result from the p-model in Fourier
% space to give it another fractal slope, e.g. to make it continuous and
% nonstationary. This is also called fractional integration. The p-model 
% itself can only produce stationary time series, i.e time series where 
% the variance is finite if you would extrapolate its power spectrum to 
% infinite large scales.
% 
% The parameter of the p-model is p. With p values close to 1 or 0 the time
% series is very peaked. With values close to 0.5 the p-model is much
% calmer; p=0.5 results in a constant unity vector.
% The parameter for the fractal integration is the slope of the power
% spectrum. Davis et al. calls slopes flatter than -1 stationary, and
% slopes between -1 and -3 nonstationary, with stationary increments. 
% These nonstationary cases are at least continuous, but not
% differentiable. Slopes steeper than -3 are nonstionary and
% differentiable.
% 
% Possible calls:
% [pModelTimeSeries] = pmodel
% [pModelTimeSeries] = pmodel(noValues)
% [pModelTimeSeries] = pmodel(noValues, p)
% [fractionalIntegratedTimeSeries] = pmodel(noValues, p, slope)
% [fractionalIntegratedTimeSeries, pModelTimeSeries] = pmodel(noValues, p, slope)
% If no number of values (noValues) is specified or it is empty, the
% default value of 256 is used.
% If no p is specified or it is empty, the default value of 0.375 is used.
% If no slope is specified, you will get a time series without fractional
% integration.
% If a slope is specified you will get the fractionally integrated time
% series, or if you use two output variables you will get both the p-model
% time series as well as its fractionally integrated version.
